# Chat-Interface
TCP Socket Chat Application Written in Python

# Description
Uses the native Python libraries for creating a socket and inputting proper info. 

# Installation
Requires Python v3.14.0+ acquired here ---> https://www.python.org/downloads/
(Optional) Git Bash -----> https://git-scm.com/install/

# Usage
Opening server.py via terminal/bash will create a new chatbox where clients can connect via client.py, the next file that you open. It will automatically broadcast any messages from client.py to the server.py and uses TCP sockets to do so. 

# Roadmap
-Admin privelages for server.py ownership (chat access, kicking users, blacklists, etc.)
-Client encryption
-Server info being logged into a database via SQL (for practice of course) 
-Database sending info back to server at the request of user
-Debugging
